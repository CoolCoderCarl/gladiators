# gladiators

A simple game modeling fighting between two teams of gladiators.  
`Red` and `Blue` team fight each other.

If the gladiator win, it will grub all the **Power** of the defeated enemy.  
If the **Power** of gladiators are equal both of them lost.  

The team with the most survived gladiators wins.  

If lost results are equal, the **Draw** will be announced.

## Prehistory
While reading book about Game Theory I decide to write this program.

The fighting is not real for sure.

Enjoy.
